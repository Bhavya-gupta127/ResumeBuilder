# PapyrusNebulae 2023 Document Cloud Hackathon: Round 2 (optional) - Resume Builder Website

This repository contains my solution for the optoinal part of Round 2 of the PapyrusNebulae 2023 Document Cloud Hackathon.
The goal is to create a user-friendly resume builder website that generates professional resumes in PDF format.
## Solution Approach

The solution is a React-based resume builder website. It captures user input for personal information, education, experience, skills, and achievements, and generates a resume in PDF format using an API call to a backend server.

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository or download the code files.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Run `npm install` to install the project dependencies. <a href="https://nodejs.org">( Download Node.js )</a>
4. The resume is generated by making an API call to a backend server running on `http://localhost:8080/resume`. Make sure the server is running and properly configured to handle this request. To do so please refer README file of resume-builder-api


## Usage

1. Start the development server by running `npm start`.
2. Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to access the website.

## Dependencies

The following dependencies are used in this project:

- `react`: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- `axios`: Promise-based HTTP client for making API requests.
- `@material-ui/core`: UI component library for Material Design.
- `@material-ui/icons`: Material Design icons for UI components.

Please make sure you have these dependencies installed before running the project.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following main files and directories:

- `App.js`: The main component that renders the entire application. It handles form submission, generates the resume PDF, and displays the preview.
- `components/Form.js`: A reusable form component that handles user input for creating the resume. It includes fields for personal information, education, experience, skills, and achievements.
- `Assets/`: A directory that stores the images used for different resume templates.

## Additional Notes

- The application uses local storage to store the resume data, so if the user refreshes the page, the entered data will persist.
